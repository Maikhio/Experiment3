        <h2 id="tobacco">3. Avoid Tobacco Products</h2>
        <p>Smoking and using other tobacco products are the leading causes of lung cancer and are linked to many other types of cancer. Quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke are essential steps in cancer prevention.</p>

        <h2 id="sun">4. Protect Yourself from the Sun</h2>
        <p>Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds can increase your risk of skin cancer. Protect your skin by wearing sunscreen, seeking shade, and wearing protective clothing.</p>

        <h2 id="screenings">5. Get Regular Screenings</h2>
        <p>Regular cancer screenings can help detect cancer early when it is most treatable. Talk to your healthcare provider about which screenings are appropriate for you based on your age, gender, and family history.</p>

        <h2 id="environment">6. Reduce Exposure to Environmental Carcinogens</h2>
        <p>Limit your exposure to environmental toxins and carcinogens, such as asbestos, radon, and certain chemicals, to reduce your risk of cancer.</p>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Environmental+Toxins" alt="Environmental Toxins">
        <p class="image-caption">Be aware of environmental risks and take steps to minimize exposure.</p>

        <h3>6.1. Test Your Home for Radon</h3>
        <p>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can increase the risk of lung cancer. Test your home for radon and take steps to mitigate it if levels are high.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While not all cancers can be prevented, adopting a healthy lifestyle and taking proactive steps can significantly reduce your risk. Stay informed, make healthy choices, and consult with healthcare professionals to protect your health.</p>
